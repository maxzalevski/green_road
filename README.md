# Green Road of Ecovillages
The Green Road of Ecovillages is a project of two NGOs, GEN Ukraine and [Permaculture in Ukraine](https://permaculture.in.ua/index.php/en/), that started already on the second day of the full-scale invasion, February 25 2022. These organisations joined forces, mobilized their networks (one of ecovillages and one of permaculture centers), and created a map of locations ready to accommodate people seeking short-term or long-term shelter. In partnership with [Global Ecovillage Network Europe](https://genukraine.com.ua/index.php/en/), we also created a map of European eco-communities ready to receive Ukrainian refugees.
